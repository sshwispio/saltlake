# codename:saltlake
Proposed Freenet Censorship and a New Internet Scheme or new Haven for Internet Dwellers that Bypasses Firewall on Transport Layer Level and Possibly the 7 Layers of OSI soon to be submitted to InfoSec Dallas, CyberArk for Project WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider). The Codename "Salt Lake" is that it uses IPv4 Bypass which doesn't require Transport Layer to be decrypted. This ignores the TCP IP Firewalls and heads to a specific Port on the Internet or Server that can be used to transmit TCP IP Data over the said Protocol used which is a Native Unix Protocol on OSI Layers, It can also be Integrated to OpenVPN also uses Socks v4 and v5 for the Routing Process. This Year alone of 2019 - 2020, will be the mark of the Reinvention of the said Vulnerability Tunneling that can Bypass, WiFi Captive Portals and even ISP Captive Portals only when you have a DSL / ADSL Connection, even SIM Router Connections that doesn't have Load / Promo. And said to be Non-Activated SIM Cards. Don't worry I am currently taking a CISCO Netacad Course right now, But as said. It might take years to completion.
