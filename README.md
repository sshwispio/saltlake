# saltlake
Proposed Freenet Censorship and Bypasses Firewall on Transport Layer and Possibly the 7 Layers of OSI soon to be submitted to InfoSec Dallas, CyberArk for Project WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider). The Codename "Salt Lake" is that it uses IPv4 Bypass which doesn't require Transport Layer to be decrypted. This ignores the TCP IP Firewalls and heads to a specific Port on the Internet that can be used to transmit TCP IP Data over the Protocol used which is a Native Unix Protocol, It can also be Integrated to OpenVPN. This Year alone of 2019 - 2020, will be the mark of the Reinvention of the said Vulnerability VPN that can Bypass, WiFi Captive Portals and even ISP Captive Portals only when you have a DSL / ADSL Connection, even SIM Router Connections that doesn't have Load / Promo. And said to be Non-Activated SIM Cards.
